Socioeconomic Indicators and Olympic Success in the EU

This project, created as part of the Czechitas Data Academy, examines the link between socioeconomic factors and Olympic success across EU countries. We explore how sports employment, investment, access to sport and others influence Olympic medal counts, aiming to provide insights into factors that may drive athletic success.

Data Sources:

Kaggle: Olympic Games dataset.
Eurostat: Data on sports employment, public/private investment, access to sports facilities, households expenditure, population, GDP etc.

Current Status:

Pandas: Cleaned and standardized data using Python (pandas).
SQL: Exported cleaned data as CSVs and loaded them into our SQL database for further transformations.

Next steps:

1. Visualization Use Power BI to show trends and correlations.
3. Dashboard: Create an interactive view of our findings.
